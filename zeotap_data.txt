What's New in Q1 of 2025?
Learn about the new features/enhancements released in Q1 of 2025.

1. Destination Enhancements
The below enhancements are now available in the Zeotap CDP App.
1.1 Newly Added Destination–Snowflake (Batch+Real Time)
Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform designed for scalable data storage, processing, and analytics. It is known for its flexibility, performance, and ease of use in handling large volumes of structured and semi-structured data.
Integrated with Zeotap CDP, it allows you to send batched and real-time data based on the audiences (segments) and workflows created in Zeotap CDP. In this setup, you establish a connection between your Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket and your Snowflake account. Zeotap CDP pushes data to your GCS bucket, where you can set up automation to receive data either in batches at fixed intervals or in real-time by configuring a Pub/Sub notification for the bucket. To know more about how to create a Destination for Snowflake and use it to send data, referhere.
1.2 Support for Amazon Consent Signal
Effective February 7, 2025, Amazon requires including a consent string or Amazon Consent Signal (amazonAdStorage,amazonUserData) for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK). Refer to theAmazon consent signal requirementsfor details. Audience uploads without consent information are rejected.
To ensure compliance, Zeotap CDP transmits theGRANTEDAmazon Consent Signal for users who qualify in an audience. Use one of the following methods to include only consented users in an audience:

2. Enhancement in Protect
2.1 Added Support for Deleting Customer Data Using Customer Data Lifecycle
Data Lifecycle is a systematic cleanup process that ensures your data in the system stays relevant and actionable. You can use this capability to create/define rules for deletingCustomer dataandNon-Customer Entity (NCE)records from a source when it becomes obsolete due to various reasons.
For example, consider a scenario where a company routinely gathers data from third-party vendors concerning product feedback. Over time, certain feedback may become outdated or irrelevant, particularly if it relates to discontinued products or resolved issues. By utilising the Data Lifecycle, administrators can establish rules to automatically delete obsolete records from the system, thereby ensuring the retention of only current and actionable information.
Now, we have enhanced theData Lifecyclemodule with the addition of theCustomer Data Lifecycletab. This feature enables a cleanup process that ensuresdemographic, behavioural, product-related, derived, and modelled dataremains relevant and actionable. To know more about how to use this feature to define rules for deleting outdated customer data from a source, referhere.
